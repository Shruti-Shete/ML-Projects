**Fashion MNIST CNN Analysis**

**Overview**

This repository contains code for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the Fashion MNIST dataset using Keras.<br />
The CNN is designed for image classification, specifically recognizing different fashion items.

**Dataset**
The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.<br />
Each image is a grayscale 28x28 pixel representation of a fashion item.<br />
The dataset includes 10 classes, each corresponding to a specific type of clothing or accessory.

**Model Architecture**
The CNN model consists of multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, dropout layers for regularization, and dense layers.<br />
The output layer uses the softmax activation function for multiclass classification.

**Performance Analysis:**

Visualize training and validation accuracy over epochs.<br />
Generate a confusion matrix to analyze classification performance.<br />
Print a classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the provided code demonstrates the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset.
